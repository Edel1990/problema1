<h1>Proactive IT and the flexible future of higher education </h1>
<h2>Matt Hall, Assistant Director of IT at Bournemouth University, explores the challenges that university IT teams are facing as they support an increase in remote learning</h2>
<p>
    Higher education is one of the many sectors facing the prospect of profound reorientation in the post-COVID-19 world. Following the government’s re-evaluation of approach, which saw students awarded predicted grades at A-level, many university leaders are concerned that taking on the extra, successful students would mean a stretch to resources – especially with social distancing and remote learning requirements needed to manage the spread of the virus.
</p>
<p>At Bournemouth University we’ve always placed a significant emphasis on the campus premium experience we offer to students, appreciative of the significant cultural, social, and educational benefits that derive from a lively campus community.</p>
<p>
    And despite the pressure on the higher education sector, we hope to be able to continue to offer all of these benefits to students in the years to come. But there’s no denying that, in the medium term at least, university education is set to become a much more flexible, blended experience for students and educators alike.
