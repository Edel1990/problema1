        <h1>Employment: Seven ways the young have been hit by Covid</h1>
        <p>
            By Eleanor Lawrie & Ben Butcher
        </p>
        <p>
            BBC News
        </p>
        <h2>Young people have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic's 
            disruption to the jobs market.</h2>
    <p class="first_hover"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/coronavirus">
    Coronavirus pandemic</a>
    </p>
    <a href="employment images/young.jpg">
         <img src="employment images/young.jpg" width="690px"
    ></a>
<p>
    The under-25s saw the biggest rise in unemployment during lockdown, and some
    graduate or entry level roles attracted thousands more applications than 
    usual.
</p>
<h2>1. Young people left the workplace first</h2>
<p>
    Under-25s were more likely to be furloughed than any other age group.
</p>
<p>
    In the first three months of lockdown, <a href= "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-july-2020/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-july-2020#demographics--age-and-gender-breakdown">half of eligible 16 to 24-year-olds</a> 
    were placed on the scheme, <a href="which supports people unable to work because of 
    the pandemic" target="_blank">which supports people unable to work because of 
        the pandemic</a>, compared with one in four 45-year-olds.
</p>
<a href="employment images/percentfurlough.png">
    <img src="employment images/percentfurlough.png" width="690px">
</a>
<p>
    They were also the age group also most likely to lose their job, with the 
    youth unemployment rate rising to 13.1%, compared with 4.1% for the whole UK.
</p>
<p>
    About <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/08/13/57080/1">  7% of 18-24 year-olds</a> 
    reported they had been made redundant because of the pandemic, compared 
    with 4% of 50-65 year-olds.
</p>
<p>
    The government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53985144">hopes 
    to address this with its Kickstart scheme</a>, which will pay employers 
    £1,500 for every 16 to 24-year-old to whom they offer a ''high quality'' 
    work placement.

    <h2>2. Under-25s now make up a third of new universal credit claims</h2>
    <p>
        As youth unemployment rose, so too did the number of young people 
    <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41487126">claiming universal credit.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        By July, just under one in three first-time universal credit claimants
        was under 25, up from one in five in March.
    </p>
    <a href="employment images/claims.png">
    <img src="employment images/claims.png" width="690px">
    </a>
    <p>
        But Ms Slaughter expects youth unemployment to get worse when the 
        furlough scheme ends in October.
    </p>
    <p>
        ''Young people are more likely to be in sectors which still aren't up
        to the levels of activity before the pandemic" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
        ''When businesses start making difficult decisions about redundancies, 
        young people are likely to be disproportionately affected.''
    </p>
    <h2>3. Young adults in northern England were worst affected</h2>
    <p>
        These changes have not been evenly felt across the country, with more 
        deprived areas seeing a quicker uptake in work-related benefits by 
        young people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using data on the uptake of universal credit and jobseeker's allowance,
        BBC analysis found that the proportion of young people on the benefits 
        had doubled between March and June. 
    </p>
    <a href="employment images/youthunemploy.png">
    <img src="employment images/youthunemploy.png" width="690px">
    </a>
    <p>
        The worst-hit areas were generally in the north of England, with parts 
        of Liverpool and Blackpool most affected.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Liverpool's Walton area, for example, one in five 16-24 year olds is
        now claiming universal credit or jobseeker's allowance - up from 7% in 
        January 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
        In total, 50 constituencies across the UK now have more than 15% of 
        young adults claiming one of the benefits.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Online graduate job vacancies fell by 60%</h2>
    <p>
        Those looking for a job fresh from university are facing a tough time
    </p>
    <p>
        The number of graduate jobs advertised <a href="https://www.cv-library.co.uk/recruitment-insight/graduate-jobs-drop-since-last-year/">fell 60.3% in the first half of
            2020</a> on one online recruitment website, compared with a 35.5% overall 
        fall in adverts.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53985144">''It's really hard to get a job''</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <a href="employment images/grad jobs.png">
    <img src="employment images/grad jobs.png" width="690px">
    </a>
    <p>
        Within that, graduate jobs advertised in marketing fell by 84%, while 
        roles in construction and administration both dropped by more than 70%.
    </p>
    <p>
        Applications only fell by 33%, meaning considerable extra competition 
        for many roles. Twice as many people applied for public sector roles 
        than the year before, and five times as many for IT vacancies. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One positive was the average graduate salary on the platform increased
        by 7.1% year-on-year to £24,626.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fall in vacancies is borne out across the UK. Positions on online 
        platform Adzuna were 45% lower in mid-September than in 2019, according
        to Office for National Statistics analysis.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Apprenticeships have stalled</h2>
    <p>
        Companies have taken on fewer apprenticeships over lockdown.
    </p>
    <p>
        From 23 March to 30 June, apprenticeship starts halved compared with 
        the previous year, but this fall was not evenly split between age groups.
    </p>
    <a href="employment images/apprenticeships.png">
    <img src="employment images/apprenticeships.png" width="690px">
    </a>
    <p>
        Unsurprisingly, the sectors which saw the sharpest drop across all age
        groups were retail and tourism, which both declined by 75%. However, 
        education placements only declined by a quarter.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Young people's pay could be lower for three years after the pandemic</h2>
    <p>
        The UK's financial watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) 
        estimates unemployment will hit 10% by the end of 2020, up from 4.1% 
        last year.
    </p>
    <p>
        If this happens, young people who do find employment will face lower 
        average wages for several years, Resolution Foundation analysis suggests,
        as they ''trade down'' to the best job available.
    </p>
    <a href="employment images/pay change.png">
    <img src="employment images/pay change.png" width="690px">
    </a>
    <p>
        Two years after leaving full-time education, it expects new education 
        leavers' hourly pay, after inflation, compared with pre-pandemic times,
        to be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>8% lower for highly qualified leavers (degree and above)</li>
        <li>6% lower for mid-qualified leavers (A-level or equivalent)</li>
        <li>13% lower for lower-qualified leavers (GCSE and below)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As happened after the 2008 recession, lower-skilled workers are likely 
        to take the biggest hit. But the effect will last longer for mid and 
        high-skilled workers, who may end up in sectors with less opportunity 
        for a pay rise than offered by traditional graduate jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
        That assumes lower-skilled workers can actually get a job. The think tank 
        predicts they are a third less likely to be in employment three years after
        entering the jobs market, than if the pandemic had never happened. 
    </p>
    <h2>7. Young people are more likely to stay in education</h2>
    <p>
        One positive outcome of the crisis is that younger people may remain 
        in education. This would shield them from the worst of the downturn, 
        and lead to higher productivity and a better-skilled workforce.
    </p>
    <a href="employment images/getty.jpg">
    <img src="employment images/getty.jpg" width="690px">
    </a>
    <p>
        To an extent, this happened in the 2008 recession. The effect may be 
        much larger this time around, says Xiaowei Xu of the Institute for 
        Fiscal Studies, as sectors like hospitality and retail are also where 
        many people first start working.
    </p>
    <p>
        ''There's an incentive to staying on in education because of how terrible
        the economy is, which means that people may receive more and better 
        education."
    </p>
    <p>
        She adds that this year's <a href="A-Level grade inflation">A-Level grade inflation</a> means some students 
        will go to a better university than they would have done.
